# barebonOS

This is a very (very very) bare bones OS which can do nothing except printing to the Screen.
It is mostly based on the awesome Tutorials on OSDev.org. Also this 
repository should serve as a sandbox to try different things e.g setting up a GDT, enabling paging
or playing around with interrupts.
